<h1> Form</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>

<p> The form design is based on a simple form validation where, if the data has been passed correctly, the application will send a message via the user's email </p>

<p> As I am currently at the beginning of my studies in React, I am doing simple projects with new challenges so that I can continue to gain new knowledge and learning. </p>
